              Hello, I'm Harish, a passionate and aspiring web developer
              dedicated to crafting seamless and user-friendly digital
              experiences. A BSC in Computer science graduate and a fervor for
              staying at the forefront of technology, I am excited to embark on
              a journey to create innovative and visually appealing web
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Driven by my curiosity and love for problem-solving, I delve into
              the realm of coding to transform ideas into interactive and
              dynamic websites. My goal is not only to write code but to create
              digital experiences that leave a lasting impact on users.
